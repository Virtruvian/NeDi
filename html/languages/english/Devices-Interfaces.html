Devices Interfaces
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
List interfaces and their graphs. This module lets you find port descriptions or compare duplex, speed or traffic etc.

<h2>Usage</h2>
List device interfaces by pressing the "Show" button. Use the "Display" select box to add or remove the columns you wish to see (Ctrl + Mouseclick).

The following filter methods are available to narrow down your search:
<ol>
<li>1 criteria matching a column within Condition A (leaving Operator at A only).
<li>2 criterias like above, but logically combined with Operator.
<li>Alternatively you can compare 2 columns directly by using a combination with "col" (To find interfaces where inbound traffic equals inbound errors for example).
</ol>

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge about regexp is very helpful when working with this module!
<li>You can save searches in Bookmarks.
<li>If the interface status is discovered, the type icon is imbued with the respective color (not realtime).
<li>Click Track if you wish to track changes on those interfaces in Node-Track
<li>The device icon links to its status, but won't be shown in the print-out.
<li>The population takes you to the Nodes-List where you get detailed information on the connected nodes.
<li>The graphs are displayed a notch smaller than what you set in User-Profile.

</ul>

Devices List
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
List devices, displaying database properties and even graphs for quick CPU, memory and temperature comparison.<p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Simply click Show to list all devices or define the criteria as desired. There are 3 modes of filtering:
<ol>
<li>1 criteria matching a column within Condition A (leaving Operator at A only).
<li>2 criterias like above, but logically combined with Operator.
<li>Alternatively you can compare 2 columns directly by using a combination with "col" (To find devices where firstseen equals lastseen for example).
<li>The selected devices can be added to the monitoring if you click the Monitor button. Go to Monitor-Setup to further configure them.
</ol>

Click Monitor to add the devices to the Monitoring table. This will allow service checks and event classification.

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge about regexp is very helpful when working with this module!
<li>You can save searches in Bookmarks.
<li>Icon, name, IF and IP address provide quick shortcuts to Device-Status, Nodes-List and the device's CLI.
<li>Unselecting the device column hides the icons to simply copy and paste the list as text.
<li>The resulting SQL query can be shown using the cog icon, if logged in as admin. It links to Other-Export to generate CSV files or the likes.
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This module allows you to manage your unused hardware. 
If an in-stock module or device's serial number is discovered on the network, it'll add a comment and create an event (if configured).

<h2>Usage</h2>
Simply use a bar code scanner (should send a "tab" upon successful reading) to scan type and serial number or enter them manually.
Specify location, condition, source/provider and warranty, if you care. If the latter one has expired a red flag appears in the appropriate field.
Select a link from any of the summaries to list individual items.<br>
<p>
If you list a certain type, the type field is populated as well for easier batch additions. The data you entered before overwrites will be used before the actual list value.
<p>
You can edit items listed via <img src="../../img/16/note.png">. The current list will stay, but you can always go to the overview by clicking the package icon on the left. Note that the focus will move to the location field (SN cannot be edited anyway, since it's the reference).
<p>
Delete an item from stock by clicking <img src="../../img/16/bcnl.png">

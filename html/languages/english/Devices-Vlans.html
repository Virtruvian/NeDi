Vlan List
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
List vlans and the respective node population on the devices.

<h2>Usage</h2>
List device vlans by pressing the "Show" button. Use the "Display" select box to add or remove the columns you wish to see (Ctrl + Mouseclick).

The following filter methods are available to narrow down your search:
<ol>
<li>1 criteria matching a column within Condition A (leaving Operator at A only).
<li>2 criterias like above, but logically combined with Operator.
<li>Alternatively you can compare 2 columns directly by using a combination with "col" (To find vlans where vlanid equals vlan name for example).
</ol>

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge about regexp is very helpful when working with this module!
<li>You can save searches in Bookmarks.
<li>The device name links to its status and the population takes you to the Nodes-List where you get detailed information on the vlan inhabitants.
</ul>

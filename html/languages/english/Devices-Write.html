Devices Write
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div class="code warn">This is a very helpful, but also ratherdangerous module!
Always use with caution, because you could create a big mess rather quickly...
</div>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Once you understand the filtering concept of Devices-List you should be able to pinpoint the group of devices you wish to access. (Note that only devices of the same operating system can be used at once).
<p>
Additionally you'll have to specify the desired commands. On IOS or similar devices you can use the Interface Configuration section (to the right) to generate ranges of commands.
<p>
A newer feature is the "Condition B" subsitution mode, where you can substitute the matches (using 2nd text field) and use the result as argument for the command in "Commands" (only 1 command supported in this mode).
<p>
<h4>Important!</h4>
<b>Click Show to verify your input before sending!</b>
<p>
You can simply Send Commands or use Configure to surround your commands with "conf t" and "end", "write mem" for devices which support this. 
<p>
<h2>Details</h2>
A couple pointers for the setup:
<ul>
<li>Make sure you adjust GUI authentication (towards the end of nedi.conf) to fit your needs.
<li>If you're unsure about it, delete html/inc/Devsend.pl to completely disable sending commands to devices!
</ul>

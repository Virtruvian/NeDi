Monitoring Events
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Incoming discovery or syslog events and snmp traps are (if enabled) gathered here. Several filter options allow you to examine problems very efficiently. Use the arrow keys (beneath show) to page around in your selection.
Conditions involving criterias (e.g. location or contact) from the devices or interfaces (e.g. IF alias) table, cannot be used to delete nodes due to query restrictions!

<h2>Usage</h2>
List device events by pressing the "Show" button.

The following filter methods are available to narrow down your search:
<ol>
<li>1 criteria matching a column within Condition A (leaving Operator at A only).
<li>2 criterias like above, but logically combined with Operator.
<li>In addition you can specify which level you want to look at.
<li>Click on the icons to get quick access to pre-defined message groups.
</ol>

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge about regexp is very helpful when working with this module!
<li>You can save searches in Bookmarks.
<li>The resulting SQL query can be shown using the cog icon, if logged in as admin. It links to Other-Export to generate CSV files or the likes.
</ul>

Monitoring Setup
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Configure how targets should be monitored and how users are notified upon failure. You'll get information about the actual status as well.
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add targets from Devices, Nodes List or Status respectively. They'll show up here afterwards.
<li>Click a target, test, alert or manually set a filter in order to avoid handling too many entries at once (especially recommended with Add, Update or Reset).
<li>Change the desired test (a tcp ping to the appropriate port, if not uptime).
<li>Enable email or SMS notification, if desired.
<li>Configure forward or delete to send certain events via mail, sms (as set by target) or discard them alltogether. If you just enter a number with "delete" selected, any events with level below that number will be discarded. Enter a "-" to reset it to default.
<li>Reset the availability counters (lost & ok) once a year (if you need to know annual availability for example).
<li><img src="../../img/16/ncon.png"> Populates dependency info, if available via links or device information (in case of node targets).
</ul>

Nodes List
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
List nodes, displaying database properties, graphs and available services.
<p>
<h4>Important!</h4>
If you list available services, make sure you don't match too many nodes as it will take a long time to scan the open ports.
<p>
Conditions involving criterias (e.g. location or contact) from the devices or interfaces (e.g. IF alias) table, cannot be used to delete nodes due to query restrictions!
<h2>Usage</h2>
List device Vlans by pressing the "Show" button. Use the "Display" select box to add or remove the columns you wish to see (Ctrl + Mouseclick).

The following filter methods are available to narrow down your search:
<ol>
<li>1 criteria matching a column within Condition A (leaving Operator at A only).
<li>2 criterias like above, but logically combined with Operator.
<li>Alternatively you can compare 2 columns directly by using a combination with "col" (To find nodes where firstseen equals lastseen for example).
</ol>

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge about regexp is very helpful when working with this module!
<li>You can save searches in Bookmarks.
<li>The resulting SQL query can be shown using the cog icon, if logged in as admin. It links to Other-Export to generate CSV files or the likes.
<li>Clicking on the NIC vendor icon takes you to Nodes-Status where you get all node details at a glance.
</ul>

Interface Reports
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Interface based reports provide information on the perimeter of your network, but also reveal internal problems or misconfiguration.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Filter on device based criterion, if desired (won't be taken into account for links to other modules).
<li>Select (multiple) reports you wish to look at.
<li>Increase the limit to see more results.
</ul>

<h3>Reports</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find out whitch switches can be replaced by smaller ones or which are getting really full. 'Alternative' restricts this statistic to ethernet interfaces.
<li>Quickly find that interface you disabled a week ago, because some infected notebook tried to attack the rest of your network.
<li>Find the busiest, flakiest or slowest interfaces of your network. Check 'Optimize' to take IF speed into account of the traffic stats and the actual traffic for the errors. 'Alternative' uses absolute counter values rather than the changes within the last discovery period.
<li>Show mismatching IF speed, duplex and vlans of links.
</ol>

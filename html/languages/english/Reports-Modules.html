Module Reports
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Need to know how many modules of a kind you've got? This report also helps, if you need to generate a HW inventory for support contracts based on serial numbers etc.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Filter on device based criterion, if desired (won't be taken into account for links to other modules).
<li>The 'Summary' presents an overview of which modules are installed in which devices.
<li>The 'Inventory' lets you generate a detailed list of modules where you can use the filter (on device type) to narrow down the selection.
<li>Check 'Alternative' to sort by model (in Summary) or device type (in Inventory) rather than values or device name.
<li>Print supplies and virtual machines are specific reports to reflect these items, which are stored in the DB as modules.
</ul>

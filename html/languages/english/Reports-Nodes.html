Node Reports
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Reports focused entirely on the computers connected to your network.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Filter on device based criterion, if desired (won't be taken into account for links to other modules).
<li>Select (multiple) reports you wish to look at.
<li>Increase the limit to see more results.
<li>Check 'Alternative' to sort keys rather than values.
</ul>

<h3>Reports</h3>
<ol>
<li>The network population at a glance.
<li>Interface statistics detect hubs or virtual machines on a managed interface, show top interface changes (e.g. travelling notebooks) and the NeDi's internal metric statistics.
<li>Empty vlans can be identifyied and eventually removed, if not needed on particular devices.
<li>IP and IF changes multiplied yield NeDi's nomad factor, an indicator for those who seem to travel a lot.
<li>Node update hisory can reveal major changes or problems in your network.
</ol>

Database Export
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Backup SQL tables, perform DB maintenance, export configurations as text files or other tables as CSV files. By default the complete DB structure including number of records is shown.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Export</h3>
Use this part to generate CSV-, configuration file archive or perform some maintenance tasks.
<h3>SQL Dump</h3>
Select (multiple) tables to be exported in SQL format. The resulting file (if gzipped) can be imported via System-Files again.
<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Perform maintenance or quickly view (the first 1000) entries of a table by clicking on the icons below them.
<li>Dump to text destination to view the output directly in the browser.
<li>Bzip2 needs more resources, but generally creates smaller archives.
<li>Depending on the amount of data you're dealing with, the module requires more memory or time to finish processing!
<li>Add timestamp to dump files by checking the clock. This will also export timestamps (and IPs) in a more human readable format.
</ul>

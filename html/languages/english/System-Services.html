System Service
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
View processes of your NeDi host and start or stop certain services. 

<h2>Usage</h2>
Click on checkmark to stop or the grey X to start either monitoring, syslog
or snmptrapd. In addition radius and iperf daemons can be controlled if the underlying
OS is configured apropriately. The line below shows the discovery status. 

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Top part shows and controls NeDi related services.
<li>Click on red X to reset discovery, in case you have to!
<li>Lower part shows all running processes.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Threads</h3>
Depending on the size and topology of your network, it makes sense to
run several discoveries at the same time. Do this by dividing the network
in a few sections using borders and different seedfiles. Then adapt your
crontab accordingly.
<p>
At the end of a run the nodes table needs to be locked during calculation, 
with that no other thread meddles with them. Furthermore should Top RRDs only
be taken care of by the last thread or they're gonna look like Picassoes.
<p>
In case a discovery terminated unexpectedly or hangs, you can reset it
by clicking on the red X.

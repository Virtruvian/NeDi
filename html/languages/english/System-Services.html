System Service
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
View processes of your NeDi host and start or stop certain services. 

<h2>Usage</h2>
Click on the Walk icon to stop or the grey X to start either monitoring, syslog,
 snmptrapd, freeradius or iperf. On the far right you see the discovery status and whether the node calculation is being performed this very instsant (nodelock).

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Top part shows and controls NeDi related services.
<li>Lower part shows all running processes and some system stats.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Threads</h3>
Depending on the size and topology of your network, it makes sense to
run several discoveries at the same time. Do this by dividing the network
in a few sections using borders and different seedfiles. Then adapt your
crontab accordingly.
<p>
At the end of a run the nodes table needs to be locked during calculation, 
with that no other thread meddles with them. Furthermore should Top RRDs only
be taken care of by the last thread or they're gonna look like Picassoes.
<p>
In case a discovery terminated unexpectedly or a nodelock hangs, you can reset it
by clicking on the red X.

Topology Locations
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
List locations created with the editor LocEd.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the Location condition to search for region-city-building patterns (substitute the dash with your $locsep).
<li>If Google Maps integration is enabled in User-Profile, maps can be displayed as well. If the coordinates are available, labeled markers (label also shown with ID Column) with appropriate colors are drawn. Markers imitate the colors of the location icons, where as red buildings (see nedi.conf) are taken into account as well.
<li>The execute column reveals easy access to other modules or Google Maps.
<li>If photos (region-city-building[-floor[something]].jpg) are found in html/log they can be accessed in the Images column.
</ul>

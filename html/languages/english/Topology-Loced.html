<h2>Introduction</h2>
Place your locations on the maps and add some comments if you want.
<h4>Important!</h4>
Only place locations in maps where it makes sense. For example, if you have a regional Map of Europe place Zurich in there but don't add buildings on that level. You should place buildings only in city maps and so forth...

<h2>Usage with Google Maps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upon selecting a location a geocode lockup is performed and the found coordinates are highlighted green in the NS & EW fields.
<li>A draggable marker is placed on the map, which can be adjusted to fit your needs. Enter a description and click the add button.
<li>The marker turns into an icon reflecting the respective location level and coordinates should stay black, since they're read from the DB now.
</ul>

<h2>Usage without Google Maps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Without Google Maps integration enabled in User-Profile png backdrops can be edited. This can be leveraged with the geo map type in Topology-Maps.
<li>At first you'll see the top level map, which is a world map by default (I'll change this as soon as we've got networks on other celestial bodies). If your network only spans one country, you may want to replace html/log/map-top.png to fit your needs.
<li>Select a region an click on the map to set the coordinates. You'll notice that values are being populated and the 'Add' button becomes 'Update', if the location already exists.
<li>Copy lower level maps to html/log (where map-top.png is). Let's say, your network sites are located in 2 regions (USA and Europe). Just name them map-USA.png and map-Europe.png. Now when you select cities in those regions, it should descent and the coordinates are referring to this map.
<li>This also works for cities (makes sense where you've got a big metropolitan network). Just create a map-Europe-Zurich.png in html/log and as soon as you click on buildings in Zurich you can place them into the metropolitan map.
</ul>

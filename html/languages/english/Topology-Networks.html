Network List

</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
List networks by VRFs for example.

<h2>Usage</h2>
List device networks by pressing the "Show" button. Use the "Display" select box to add or remove the columns you wish to see (Ctrl + Mouseclick).

The following filter methods are available to narrow down your search:
<ol>
<li>1 criteria matching a column within Condition A (leaving Operator at A only).
<li>2 criterias like above, but logically combined with Operator.
<li>Alternatively you can compare 2 columns directly by using a combination operatore with "col" (To find modules where type equals description for example).
</ol>

<h2>Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge about regexp is very helpful when working with this module!
<li>You can save searches in Bookmarks.
<li>The resulting SQL query is always shown at the end of the table. It can be used in Other-Export to generate CSV files or the likes.
<li> The device name links to its status.
</ul>
